from server.optimization.real_time_optimizer import real_time_optimizer

@app.middleware("http")
async def performance_middleware(request, call_next):
    start_time = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)
    process_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    await real_time_optimizer.record_performance({
        "response_time": process_time,
        "endpoint": request.url.path,
        "status_code": response.status_code
    })
    return response
```

2. **Integrate Advanced Reasoning**:
```python
# Add to LEXUnifiedConsciousness
from server.reasoning.advanced_reasoning_engine import advanced_reasoning

async def _execute_action_plan(self, action_plan, user_input, user_id):
    # Use advanced reasoning for complex requests
    if action_plan["complexity"] == "high":
        reasoning_result = await advanced_reasoning.reason(
            user_input, {"task_type": action_plan["primary_action"]}
        )
        action_plan["reasoning_chain"] = reasoning_result["reasoning_chain"]
    
    # Continue with existing logic...
```

3. **Enable Multimodal Processing**:
```python
# Add to chat routes
from server.multimodal.fusion_engine import multimodal_fusion, ModalityInput, ModalityType

@router.post("/chat/multimodal")
async def multimodal_chat(files: List[UploadFile], text: str):
    modal_inputs = [
        ModalityInput(
            modality=ModalityType.TEXT,
            data=text,
            confidence=0.9,
            metadata={},
            timestamp=datetime.now(),
            source="user"
        )
    ]
    
    # Add file inputs
    for file in files:
        if file.content_type.startswith("image/"):
            modal_inputs.append(ModalityInput(
                modality=ModalityType.VISION,
                data=await file.read(),
                confidence=0.8,
                metadata={"filename": file.filename},
                timestamp=datetime.now(),
                source="user"
