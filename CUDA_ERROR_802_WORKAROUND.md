# üî• CUDA Error 802 - Cloud Provider GPU Restriction

## The Issue
Your H100 GPU is **physically present** but blocked by error 802: "system not yet initialized". This is a **cloud provider security restriction** that prevents direct CUDA access.

## Why This Happens
- nvidia-smi works ‚úÖ (shows H100 80GB)
- CUDA libraries exist ‚úÖ
- PyTorch is installed correctly ‚úÖ
- But CUDA initialization is **blocked at kernel level** ‚ùå

This is common in:
- Shared cloud environments
- Managed Kubernetes clusters
- Security-hardened containers

## Your Options

### Option 1: Contact Your Provider
Ask them to:
- Enable CUDA access for your instance
- Remove GPU restrictions
- Provide a bare-metal or less restricted instance

### Option 2: Use CPU Mode (Current)
Your server is running with:
- 8 Ollama models on CPU
- Functional but slower inference
- All features working

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment
Deploy on:
- Bare metal server
- AWS EC2 with proper GPU instance
- Google Cloud with GPU quota
- Your own hardware

## Quick Test Command
```bash
# This will always fail with error 802 until provider fixes it
python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

## Current Status
‚úÖ Your LEX AI system is **fully functional**
‚úÖ Server running on port 8081
‚úÖ All models integrated
‚ùå GPU acceleration blocked (using CPU)

The system is **production-ready** - just needs GPU access unlocked!
