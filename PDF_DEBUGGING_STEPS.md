# üîç PDF Response Debugging Guide

## If PDFs Still Give Short Responses

### 1. Check Your Models
Run `ollama list` to see installed models. For best PDF summaries, you need:
- **dolphin-mixtral:latest** (best for comprehensive summaries)
- **mixtral:8x7b** (good alternative)
- **llama2:13b** or larger

Small models like llama2:7b may struggle with long summaries.

### 2. Install Better Models
```bash
ollama pull dolphin-mixtral:latest
# or
ollama pull mixtral:8x7b
```

### 3. Test with Diagnostic Script
Run the diagnostic script I created:
```bash
python diagnose_pdf_issue.py
```

This will:
- Show available models
- Test each model's ability to generate long responses
- Identify which models are truncating output

### 4. Manual Testing
Try this in your terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "dolphin-mixtral:latest",
  "prompt": "Write a 1000 word essay about insurance",
  "options": {"num_predict": 8000}
}'
```

### 5. Common Issues

**Issue**: "The document appears to be..."
- **Cause**: Model is giving generic response
- **Fix**: Ensure PDF text is properly extracted (not image-based PDF)

**Issue**: Response cuts off mid-sentence
- **Cause**: Token limit or model limitation
- **Fix**: Use larger model or increase num_predict

**Issue**: Very short responses despite fixes
- **Cause**: Model may not support long outputs
- **Fix**: Install dolphin-mixtral or mixtral

### 6. Workarounds

If models still won't generate long summaries:
1. Ask for specific sections: "What are all the property details in the PDF?"
2. Ask multiple questions: "List all financial information" then "List all safety features"
3. Use prompts like: "Extract and list EVERY piece of information from this document"

### 7. Check PDF Quality
Some PDFs may have issues:
- Scanned images (no extractable text)
- Corrupted text encoding
- Complex layouts that confuse text extraction

Test with a simple text PDF first to isolate the issue.
