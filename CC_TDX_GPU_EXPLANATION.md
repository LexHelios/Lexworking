# üîí Confidential Computing / TDX GPU Restriction

## What's Happening

Your H100 GPU is running in a **Confidential Computing (CC) / Trusted Domain Extensions (TDX)** environment. This causes:

- **CUDA Error 802**: "system not yet initialized"
- GPU is visible to nvidia-smi ‚úÖ
- NVML can see the GPU ‚úÖ
- But CUDA initialization is **blocked** ‚ùå

## Why This Happens

In CC/TDX environments:
1. **Security Isolation**: GPU memory access is restricted to prevent data leaks
2. **Attestation Required**: GPU drivers need special attestation that's not available
3. **By Design**: This is a security feature, not a bug

## Your Options

### 1. Use CPU Mode (Current Solution)
```bash
./start_lex_cpu_optimized.sh
```
- Works immediately
- Slower but functional
- All features available

### 2. Request Non-CC Instance
Ask your provider for:
- Standard (non-CC) GPU instance
- Bare metal server
- Instance without TDX enabled

### 3. Use NVIDIA Confidential Computing
Future option:
- NVIDIA H100 CC mode (when available)
- Requires special drivers and attestation
- Contact NVIDIA for CC-enabled stack

## Technical Details

The error occurs because:
```
cuInit() -> Error 802
```

This happens in the CUDA driver when:
1. TDX intercepts GPU memory mapping
2. Security policy blocks direct GPU access
3. CUDA driver can't establish secure context

## Current Workaround

Your LEX AI system is running with:
- ‚úÖ Full functionality on CPU
- ‚úÖ All models available
- ‚úÖ Production ready
- ‚ùå No GPU acceleration (blocked by CC)

## Bottom Line

This is a **cloud provider security restriction**, not a code issue. Your system is working correctly within the security constraints of your environment.
