### API Endpoints:
- **Text**: `POST /api/v1/lex`
- **Multimodal**: `POST /api/v1/lex/multimodal`
- **Status**: `GET /orchestration-stats`

### Model Selection:
- LEX automatically detects image generation requests
- Routes to appropriate model based on prompt
- Falls back gracefully if ComfyUI not running

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### ComfyUI Not Starting:
1. Check Python version (3.10+ required)
2. Ensure CUDA/cuDNN installed for GPU
3. Check port 8188 not in use

### Models Not Loading:
1. Verify model files in `ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/`
2. Check file permissions
3. Ensure enough VRAM (8GB+ recommended)

### LEX Not Generating Images:
1. Verify ComfyUI is running: http://localhost:8188
2. Check Docker logs: `docker logs lexworking-api`
3. Test ComfyUI directly first
