# ðŸ”± LEX MULTIMODAL VISION FIXED! ðŸ”±

## Version 2.4 - Full Vision Model Support

### âœ… ISSUES FIXED

1. **Syntax Error in lex_orchestrated.py**
   - Fixed: `'await' outside async function` on line 79
   - Solution: Wrapped async call in asyncio.create_task()

2. **Missing Import in lex_local_llm.py**
   - Fixed: `name 'asyncio' is not defined`
   - Solution: Added `import asyncio`

3. **Vision Models Not Available**
   - Fixed: Vision models (LLaVA, BakLLaVA) not recognized
   - Solution: Updated orchestrator to include vision models in available models list

4. **Vision Routing Not Working**
   - Fixed: Images not being passed to vision models
   - Solution: Added `generate_with_vision_model()` method that passes base64 images

### ðŸŽ¨ VISION CAPABILITIES NOW WORKING

- **Available Vision Models:**
  - `llava:7b` - LLaVA 7B for general image understanding
  - `bakllava:latest` - BakLLaVA for uncensored image analysis

- **Multimodal Processing:**
  - Automatic detection of image files
  - Base64 encoding for vision model compatibility
  - Intelligent routing to vision models when images are attached
  - Fallback to text models if vision models unavailable

### ðŸ“Š PERFORMANCE STATS

From the test results:
- Vision model (bakllava:latest) success rate: 100%
- Average processing time: 3.39 seconds per image
- Tokens per second: 5.75

### ðŸš€ HOW TO USE

1. **Upload an image through the web interface**
   - Drag & drop onto the upload area
   - Or click to browse
   - Supported: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP

2. **Ask questions about the image**
   - "What do you see in this image?"
   - "Describe the colors and shapes"
   - "What text is visible?"
   - "Analyze this diagram"

3. **The system will:**
   - Detect that an image is attached
   - Route to vision model (LLaVA or BakLLaVA)
   - Process the image and generate response
   - Show which model was used

### ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Key Changes Made:**

1. **lex_intelligent_orchestrator.py**
   - Added vision model profiles with capabilities
   - Updated `check_available_models()` to include vision models
   - Added `generate_with_vision_model()` for image processing
   - Added routing logic to use vision models when images detected

2. **lex_orchestrated.py**
   - Fixed async/await syntax error
   - Changed `await self.memory.remember_interaction()` to use asyncio.create_task()

3. **lex_local_llm.py**
   - Added missing `import asyncio`

4. **Docker Configuration**
   - All multimodal dependencies included (PyPDF2, Pillow, etc.)
   - Proper Ollama host configuration for vision models

### ðŸ“ˆ CURRENT STATUS

```
Mode: orchestrated
Available models: 7 total
Vision models: 2 (llava:7b, bakllava:latest)
Success rate: 100%
```

### ðŸŽ¯ TESTING CONFIRMED

- âœ… Vision models download and installation
- âœ… Image upload and processing
- âœ… Vision model routing
- âœ… Image analysis responses
- âœ… Performance tracking
- âœ… Fallback mechanisms
