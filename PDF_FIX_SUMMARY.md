# ðŸ“„ PDF Processing Fix Summary

## The Issue
PDFs were showing incomplete responses: "The document appears to be a"

## Root Causes Found

1. **Token Limits**: Default token limit of 2000 was too low for document analysis
2. **Prompt Formatting**: PDF prompts needed better structure
3. **Response Cutoff**: Responses were being truncated mid-sentence

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced PDF Prompt Preparation
**File**: `lex_multimodal_processor.py`
- Improved the PDF prompt format to be more comprehensive
- Increased text preview from 2000 to 3000 characters
- Added clearer instructions for the model

### 2. Increased Token Limits for Documents
**File**: `lex_intelligent_orchestrator.py`
- Document analysis tasks now get 4000 tokens (up from 2000)
- Added special handling for document_analysis task type

### 3. Incomplete Response Detection
**File**: `lex_intelligent_orchestrator.py`
- Added detection for incomplete PDF responses
- Automatic retry with more explicit prompts
- Retry uses 4000 token limit and better prompt structure

## How It Works Now

1. **PDF Upload**: User uploads a PDF file
2. **Text Extraction**: PyPDF2 extracts text content from all pages
3. **Prompt Preparation**: Creates structured prompt with clear instructions
4. **Model Selection**: Routes to appropriate text model (not vision)
5. **Response Generation**: 
   - Initial attempt with increased tokens
   - If response < 100 chars, retry with explicit prompt
   - Prepends "Based on the PDF document provided, " for context

## Testing

Created `fix_pdf_responses.py` to test PDF processing pipeline.

## Result

PDFs should now generate complete, detailed responses instead of cutting off mid-sentence.
