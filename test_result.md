    message: "Backend testing completed. Server is mostly operational with 4/6 tests passing. Critical issues found: 1) Rate limiting bug preventing LEX API from working (500 errors), 2) WebSocket security restrictions preventing connections (403 errors). Performance optimization features are working well - Redis caching enabled, database connection pooling active, comprehensive metrics available. Health check and performance endpoints are fully functional."

## Detailed Test Results

### ‚úÖ Working Components:
1. **Health Check** - Comprehensive health monitoring with performance metrics
2. **WebSocket Status** - Configuration and statistics reporting
3. **Performance Metrics** - Detailed optimization and cache statistics
4. **Additional Endpoints** - Root interface and documentation

### ‚ùå Critical Issues:
1. **LEX API Endpoint** - Rate limiting implementation bug causing 500 errors
2. **WebSocket Connections** - Security restrictions preventing real-time communication

### üîß Technical Details:
- **Server Type:** LEX Production Optimized with Redis caching and database pooling
- **Port:** 8000
- **Cache Status:** Enabled with 0% hit rate (no requests processed due to API bug)
- **Database Pool:** 20 active connections, 20 available
- **Security Features:** Rate limiting, CORS, input validation, security headers
- **Performance Optimization:** Response optimization active, effectiveness at 0% due to API issues

### üìä Performance Metrics Available:
- Cache performance statistics
- Database query timing
- WebSocket connection statistics
- Cost savings tracking
- Optimization effectiveness scoring
