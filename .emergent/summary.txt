The previous AI engineer meticulously advanced the LEX AI system through production readiness phases: Security, Infrastructure, Performance, and Feature Enhancement. Initial efforts focused on security hardening (rate limiting, secure FastAPI setup), database optimizations (SQLite, backups), and performance improvements (Redis caching, connection pooling). A significant portion of the recent work involved successfully building and debugging a Modern React Dashboard with WebSocket streaming, addressing numerous frontend compilation errors, backend rate limiting bugs, and supervisor configuration issues. The work culminated in a functional dashboard. The conversation then pivoted dramatically, with the user requesting the implementation of a comprehensive OMNIPOTENT AGENT SYSTEM, focusing immediately on unrestricted image and video generation given hardware constraints. The engineer has confirmed feasibility and outlined a multi-phase plan for this ambitious new direction.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to prepare the LEX AI system, comprising a React frontend and FastAPI backend with MongoDB (currently SQLite), for production deployment on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS at . The phased approach prioritized Security, then Stability, Performance, and Infrastructure hardening.
Initial requirements included:
1.  **Immediate Fixes:** Environment variable management (OpenRouter, Alibaba keys, ), removing hardcoded credentials,  setup, .
2.  **Backend Optimization:** Error handling, request validation, rate limiting, logging, health checks, DB query optimization, connection pooling, caching, metrics.
3.  **Frontend Optimization:** Production bundle, code splitting, lazy loading, PWA, error boundaries.
4.  **Infrastructure & DevOps:** Docker (initially intended, then scripted solutions), Nginx optimization, SSL/Security, Monitoring & Logging.
5.  **Database Optimization:** SQLite indexing, WAL mode, automated backups, potential PostgreSQL migration.
6.  **Testing & Quality Assurance:** Comprehensive test suite, performance benchmarks, linters, pre-commit hooks.
7.  **Performance Optimization:** Response streaming, request queuing, Redis/CDN caching.
8.  **Scalability Preparations:** Stateless design, load balancer readiness.

The current, new requirement is the development of an OMNIPOTENT AGENT SYSTEM with capabilities like computer control, self-evolving AI, autonomous code generation, zero-downtime deployments, multi-framework integration, web intelligence, and self-healing features. Specifically, the immediate focus is on integrating unrestricted image and video generation models.

**Directory Structure (Relevant parts from trajectory):**


**Key Files and Changes Made in the Trajectory:**

*   : **Importance:** Stores frontend-specific environment variables, particularly . **Changes:** Created to correctly provide the backend URL to the React app.
*   : **Importance:** The entry HTML file for the React application. **Changes:** Created to resolve  errors, which previously couldn't find a required file.
*   : **Importance:** The main component orchestrating the new modern dashboard. **Changes:** Heavily modified multiple times to:
    *   Integrate  and  hooks.
    *   Manage routing (though later simplified to remove it).
    *   Render various components like , , , , , .
    *   Fix import/export issues and unused variable warnings.
    *   Simplified to a minimal working version to resolve persistent compilation errors, then enhanced again.
*   : **Importance:** Custom hook for WebSocket communication with the backend. **Changes:** Created, then updated to correctly use  from the environment. Exports were fixed to support named and default imports.
*   : **Importance:** Custom hook for tracking and exposing frontend performance metrics. **Changes:** Created, and exports were fixed to support named and default imports.
*   : **Importance:** The primary UI for chat interactions, integrating WebSocket streaming. **Changes:** Created, then significantly simplified by removing , syntax highlighting components, and various Material-UI imports (e.g., , , ) to resolve compilation errors and make it renderable. State variables () and unused imports were also cleaned up.
*   : **Importance:** Provides error boundaries for React components. **Changes:** Created, then had imports fixed to resolve compilation issues.
*   : **Importance:** Defines TypeScript types for chat-related data. **Changes:** Created to resolve type errors in .
*   : **Importance:** The primary FastAPI backend server, integrating all security and performance features. **Changes:** Modified to:
    *   Correctly integrate WebSocket streaming by adding  endpoint.
    *   Fix multiple  rate limiting issues: incorrect decorator application, incorrect parameter naming ( vs ).
    *   Supervisor configuration () was updated to correctly point to this file as the backend server and ensure proper working directory.
*   : **Importance:** Supervisor configuration for managing backend and frontend processes. **Changes:** Modified to correct  paths and  directives, ensuring the backend () and frontend services start correctly.

<current_work>
The most recent development cycle focused on two major areas:

1.  **Completing the Modern React Dashboard with WebSocket Streaming**: The AI engineer successfully established the foundational backend WebSocket streaming endpoint () and initialized the core React application (, , ). A significant effort was then dedicated to troubleshooting and resolving numerous compilation errors and runtime issues within the React frontend, including:
    *   Creating missing directories and essential components (, , ,  like , , , , ).
    *   Fixing import/export issues within React hooks (, ) and .
    *   Creating  to resolve frontend build errors.
    *   Simplifying complex React components like  by removing problematic dependencies (e.g., , specific Material-UI elements, syntax highlighter) and unused imports to achieve a working state.
    *   Creating missing TypeScript types ().
    *   Debugging and fixing backend issues affecting the frontend, specifically correcting the  rate limiting decorator application and parameter naming in , and updating the backend                          RUNNING   pid 45, uptime 0:00:03

    *   The frontend is now rendering a Beautiful LEX Command Center dashboard with system status, performance metrics, quick actions, and real-time toast notifications, confirming a working WebSocket connection.

2.  **Initiating the Omnipotent Agent System Development**: Following the successful deployment of the enhanced dashboard, the user requested the development of a large-scale OMNIPOTENT AGENT SYSTEM. The engineer has reviewed the 1,500-line implementation plan for this system and committed to building it. The immediate focus, as confirmed by the user, is on integrating unrestricted image and video generation capabilities using self-hosted Stable Diffusion models (e.g., Automatic1111, ComfyUI), with an initial plan to install dependencies and set up the core agent foundation. The engineer has acknowledged the system's hardware constraints (7.8GB RAM, no GPU) and planned memory-optimized approaches for these new capabilities.
