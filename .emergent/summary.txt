<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the LEX AI system's production readiness, following a user-driven, phased approach: Security, Infrastructure, then Performance, and finally Feature Enhancement. The initial analysis identified core system components and existing issues. The engineer meticulously implemented security hardening (secret management, rate limiting, security headers, logging) and database optimizations as per explicit user instructions, demonstrating adaptability by pivoting from Docker to script-based backups and blue-green deployments due to environmental constraints. Subsequently, performance optimizations like Redis caching and connection pooling were integrated. The current focus, as directed by the user, is on feature enhancement, specifically a modern React dashboard with WebSocket streaming. The engineer shows a strong ability to adhere to precise instructions, manage dependencies, and test components incrementally, ensuring the live production system's stability.

<product_requirements>
The mission is to prepare the LEX AI system for production deployment, hosted on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB (though currently using SQLite). The application  runs on port 8000, proxied by Nginx. The system is live with active users at .

The task involves:
1.  **Immediate Fixes:** Configure GitHub secrets, push changes,  sensitive files, add . Validate and manage environment variables (OpenRouter, Alibaba keys, ), remove hardcoded credentials.
2.  **Backend Optimization:** Error handling, request validation, rate limiting (slowapi), logging with rotation, health checks, database query optimization, connection pooling, request timeouts, API response caching, metrics collection. Model management (fallback chains, monitoring, cost tracking), Memory system (SQLite indexing, WAL, backups, data retention, compression).
3.  **Frontend Optimization:** Build production bundle, code splitting, lazy loading, bundle size optimization, PWA, service worker, error boundaries, image optimization, static file minification, cache headers, CDN, compression, favicon/meta tags, CSP.
4.  **Infrastructure & DevOps:** Docker setup (, ), Nginx optimization (HTTP/2, security headers, rate limiting, timeouts, gzip), SSL/Security (Let's Encrypt, HSTS, security headers, fail2ban), Monitoring & Logging (rotation, centralized logging, APM, uptime, alerts, DB monitoring, API usage tracking).
5.  **Database Optimization:** Add SQLite indexes, enable WAL, automated backups, data archival. Consider PostgreSQL migration.
6.  **Testing & Quality Assurance:** Comprehensive test suite (>80% coverage), performance benchmarks, load testing, linters (Black, Flake8, ESLint, Prettier), pre-commit hooks, documentation.
7.  **Performance Optimization:** Response streaming, request queuing, memory usage, caching (Redis, CDN), critical CSS inlining.
8.  **Scalability Preparations:** Stateless design, Redis session management, load balancer readiness, CDN, queue system.

The primary goal is to ensure the system is production-ready, optimized, and properly configured without disrupting current live users, emphasizing a Security-First approach followed by Stability, Performance, and Infrastructure hardening.
