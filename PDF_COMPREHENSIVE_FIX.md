# ðŸ“„ PDF Comprehensive Summary Fix

## Changes Made to Fix Short PDF Summaries

### 1. Token Limit Increased to 8000
**File**: `lex_intelligent_orchestrator.py`
- Document analysis now gets 8000 tokens (was 4000)
- Retry logic also uses 8000 tokens
- This allows for much longer, detailed responses

### 2. Document Analysis Task Detection
**File**: `lex_intelligent_orchestrator.py`
- Added "document_analysis" task pattern with keywords:
  - "summary", "summarize", "document", "pdf", "analyze", "overview"
- Patterns to detect: "summarize", "what is this document", "analyze the pdf"
- Complexity boost of 0.4 for proper routing

### 3. Enhanced System Prompts for Documents
**File**: `lex_intelligent_orchestrator.py`
- Special system prompt for document_analysis tasks
- Instructs model to provide:
  - Property/Subject Overview
  - Key Details and Statistics
  - Important Features
  - Risk Factors or Concerns
  - Overall Assessment
- Emphasizes being thorough with specific numbers, dates, and facts

### 4. Improved PDF Processing
**File**: `lex_multimodal_processor.py`
- Increased text extraction from 10,000 to 20,000 characters
- Extract first 10 pages instead of 5
- Increased prompt text content from 3,000 to 10,000 characters

### 5. Explicit Instructions in Prompts
**File**: `lex_multimodal_processor.py`
- Added IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS section emphasizing:
  1. COMPREHENSIVE and DETAILED summaries
  2. Include ALL key information
  3. Use specific numbers, dates, names, facts
  4. Organize with clear sections
  5. NO short or incomplete responses
  6. Several paragraphs minimum

## Result

- Detailed property/document overviews
- All key statistics and numbers
- Section-by-section breakdowns
- Complete feature lists
